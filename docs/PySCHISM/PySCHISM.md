# Overview
PySCHISM is a Python interface for handling SCHISM runs.
It was originally written by Jaime R. Calzada and provides many convinient tools for preparing model inputs.

The package is available on GitHub: [schism-dev/pyschism](https://github.com/schism-dev/pyschism)
and can be easily installed by

`pip install pyschism` (see more details on the GitHub page).

PySCHISM is currently used to drive the automated model runs for the operational forecast of [STOFS-3D](https://eos.org/science-updates/forecasting-compound-floods-in-complex-coastal-regions)

PySCHISM does not have many post-processing tools at the moment.
We are actively developing these tools.
