PySCHISM is a Python interface for handling SCHISM runs.
It provides many convinient tools for preparing model inputs.
The package is available on GitHub: [schism-dev/pyschism](https://github.com/schism-dev/pyschism)
and can be easily installed by "pip install pyschism" (see more details on the GitHub page).

PySCHISM does not have many post-processing tools at the moment.
