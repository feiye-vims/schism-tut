{: .no_toc }

As mentioned in the [SCHISM Manual] (http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/SCHISM_v5.9-Manual.pdf),
a preliminary manual for the WWM module can be found in: src/WWMIII/Manual/manual.tex,
which is a latex src file and can be opened in latex or online tex tools (e.g., Overleaf).
For the detailed theory and numerical methods used in WWM, you can consult Dr. Aron Rolandâ€™s PhD
[thesis](http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/Roland_2008_PHD_thesis.pdf).

Other user contributed resources are listed in the sub-sections.
