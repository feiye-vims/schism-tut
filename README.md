For new users of SCHISM, please check SCHISM's online [manual](https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/index.html) first,
where you have a better chance of finding what you are looking for.

This online repository was initially intended as a collection of SCHISM users' experience on different applications.
Since the publication of SCHISM's online [manual](https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/index.html),
contents that are suitable for new users have been moved there.
We will continue to use this repository for applications that are more advanced or not ready for public dissemination but may be included in the SCHISM manual in the future.
